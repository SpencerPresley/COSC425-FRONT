# End of Semester TODO for the team.

Task are listed in priority order.

1. [ ] Export raw data in spreadsheet format to deliver to client.  
2. [ ] Add theme data to category pages.
3. [ ] Finish auxillary stats
   - Total citations for category.
   - Total citations per paper per category. Needed for displaying most influential papers.
   - Total citation per author per category. Needed for displaying most influential faculty.
   - Average citations per paper per category.
4. [ ] Improve UI/UX
   - [ ] SU colors for light and dark theme. We do not need to go crazy here. Just use a little bit of the maroon and a little bit of the gold on areas of the website which will not impede with readability or user experience. Use common sense.
   - [ ] Current style leads to jarring color changes when toggling between light and dark mode. See a category page where when toggling to light mode the display box turns entirely black.
   - [ ] Add space between articles and faculty lists.
   - [ ] Add department list to faculty page.
   - [ ] Clickable links need to be underlined and bolded. They should be highlighted in the SU Maroon color, or a lighter red color if SU Maroon impedes readability. On hover opacity should drop to add a darkening effect.
5. [ ] Add modal popup for titles, when clicked popup will appear displaying that papers abstract.
   - A JSON file already exists which associates abstracts and titles.
6. [ ] Document code verbosely. 
   - [ ] Make a branch of the final main release and go through all the code you've been involved in and write abundant amounts of comments. I'm talking 2-3 comments per individual line. When we come back this will help immensely with getting back up to speed on how we implemented things.
   - [ ] Write general documentation of the code and how it's used and why it was written how it was.
